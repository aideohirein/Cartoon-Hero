		<h2>About Harley Quinn</h2>

				Harley Quinn, originally wasn't supposed to be a recurring character within Batman's DC Universe, but due to popular demand she was brought back. Initially the character was the Jokers henchman/girlfriend, but thankfully this has changed over the years. Now when one delves in to the character, you'll find that she's more than just the Jokers girlfriend.
